' Define the components of the neuron
[Input A1] as A1
[Input A2] as A2
[Input An] as An
() Sum as Summation
[Activation Function f(x)] as Activation
[Output y] as Output

' Define the relationships and flow
A1 -[#blue,bold]-> Summation : *W1* (weight)
A2 -[#blue,bold]-> Summation : *W2* (weight)
An -[#blue,bold]-> Summation : *Wn* (weight)

Summation -[#red,bold]-> Activation : x (weighted sum + bias)
Activation -[#green,bold]-> Output : y (result)

' Optional: Add a note about the bias
note top of Summation
  Includes bias (b)
end note

' Optional: group the core neuron parts
'together {
